== Description

The Service Map is a map that defines the logic of the service that will
be created when the server starts.

Pedestal may add other keys to this map for its own use. Other applications
should treay any such keys and their values as implementation values details
and their behaviour will remain unspecified.


[cols="s,d,d,d", options="header", grid="rows"]
|===
| Key | Always present? | Type | Description

| `:io.pedestal.http/routes`
| Y
| Function, something which satisfies `io.pedestal.http.route/ExpandableRoutes`, or sequence of maps
| Something that satisfies the link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-ExpandableRoutes[`io.pedestal.http.route/ExpandableRoutes`] protocol, a function that returns routes when called, or a seq of route maps that defines a service's routes. If passing in a seq of route maps, it's recommended to use link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-expand-routes[`io.pedestal.http.route/expand-routes`] as the full route map contains some redundancies to make processing easier which `expand-routes` adds automatically.

| `:io.pedestal.http/router`
| N
| Keyword or route constructor
| The router implementation to to use. Can be `:linear-search`, `:map-tree` `:prefix-tree`, or a custom link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.router.html#var-Router[`io.pedestal.http.route.router/Router`] constructor function. Defaults to `:map-tree`, which falls back to `:prefix-tree`.

| `:io.pedestal.http/resource-path`
| N
| string
| File path used as root by the link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares.html#var-resource[`io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares/resource`] interceptor. If non-`nil`, the interceptor is added. Default is `nil`.

| `:io.pedestal.http/type`
| Y
| Keyword
| Container for service. One of `:jetty`, `:immutant`, or `:tomcat`.

| `:io.pedestal.http/join?`
| N
| Boolean
| If `false`, do not block the thread that starts the web server. Passed to the container.


| `:io.pedestal.http/host`
| N
| String
| Hostname, e.g., "localhost". Passed to the container.

| `:io.pedestal.http/container-options`
| N
| Map
| Map of options to pass to the container. See link:index#_deployment_and_operations[Deployment and Operations] for container-specific options.

| `:io.pedestal.http/port`
| N
| Integer
| Port for the running server. If `nil`, Pedestal defaults to port 80 and HTTP.

| `:io.pedestal.http/interceptors`
| N
| Vector
| Vector of items that satisfy link:../api/pedestal.interceptor/io.pedestal.interceptor.html#var-IntoInterceptor[`io.pedestal.interceptor/IntoInterceptor`]. No additional interceptors are added if this key is non-`nil`. The default interceptors are defined by the service map options and link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.html#var-default-interceptors[`io.pedestal.http/default-interceptors`].

| `:io.pedestal.http/file-path`
| N
| String
| File path used as root by the link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares.html#var-file[`io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares/file`] interceptor. If non-`nil`, this interceptor is added. Default is `nil`.

| `:io.pedestal.http/method-param-name`
| N
| Keyword
| Query string parameter used to set the current HTTP verb. Default is `:_method`.


| `:io.pedestal.http/allowed-origins`
| N
| Function, map, or sequence of strings
| Determines which origins are allowed for the link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.cors.html#var-allow-origin[`io.pedestal.http.cors/allow-origin`] interceptor. If non-`nil`, this interceptor is added. Default is `nil`. Allowed values are a function of one argument that returns a truthy value when an origin is allowed; a map containing the following keys and values `:allowed-origins` sequence of strings or a function, `:creds` boolean indicating whether the client is allowed to send credentials, `:max-age` a long indicating the number of seconds a client should cache the response, and :methods, indicating accepted HTTP methods, defaulting to "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, PATCH, OPTIONS"; or a sequence of strings matching the the scheme, host and port (`scheme://host:port`) of allowed origins.

| `:io.pedestal.http/not-found-interceptor`
| N
| `io.pedestal.interceptor/Interceptor`
| Interceptor to use when returning a 404 Not Found response. Default is the link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.html#var-not-found[`io.pedestal.http/not-found`] interceptor.

| `:io.pedestal.http/mime-types`
| N
| Map of String -> String
| Mime-types map used by the link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares.html#var-content-type[`io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares/content-type`] interceptor. Default is `{}`.

| `:io.pedestal.http/enable-session`
| N
| Map
| A settings map to pass to the link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares.html#var-session[`io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares/session`] interceptor. Settings are session-store specific. If non-`nil`, this interceptor is added. Default is `nil`.

| `:io.pedestal.http/enable-csrf`
| N
| Map
| A settings map to pass to the link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.csrf.html#var-anti-forgery[`io.pedestal.http.csrf/anti-forgery`] interceptor. This implies sessions are enabled. If non-`nil`, this interceptor is added. Keys are `:read-token`, a function that takes a request and returns an anti-forgery token or `nil` if the token does not exist, `:cookie-token`, a truthy value for CSRF double-submit cookies; `:error-response` a function which takes the response body and returns a 403 Not Authorized response; and `:error-handler`, a function which takes the context and returns the appropriate response. Only one of `:error-response` or `:error-handler` may be specified. Default is `nil`.

| `:io.pedestal.http/secure-headers`
| N
| map of keywork -> string
| A settings map for various secure headers. Keys are: [`:hsts-settings` `:frame-options-settings` `:content-type-settings` `:xss-protection-settings`] If non-`nil`, the link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.secure-headers.html#var-secure-headers[`io.pedestal.http.secure-headers/secure-headers`] interceptor is added.  Defaults are `{:htst-header "max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains", :frame-options-settings "DENY", :content-type-settings "nosniff", :xss-protection-settings "1; mode=block"}`.

| `:io.pedestal.http/service-fn`
| N
| function
| A function which can be used as an implementation of the `javax.servlet.Servlet.service` method. The function is defined by link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.html#var-create-server[`io.pedestal.http/create-server`].

| `:io.pedestal.http/servlet`
| N
| `javax.servlet.Servlet`
| Present if the servlet is running.

| `:io.pedestal.http/start-fn`
| N
| function
| Zero-arity function that starts the server.

| `:io.pedestal.http/stop-fn`
| N
| function
| Zero-arity function that stops the server.

| `:io.pedestal.http/chain-provider`
